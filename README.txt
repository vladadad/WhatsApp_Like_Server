Hello, I will shortly explain how to use this program correctly

In this project we had to create a "WhatsApp" like applicetion.
3 clients are connecting to the server and message each other.
When one client send a message to the chat room every one in that same chatroom sees this message. 

* First: When using this code make sure you have 4 terminals running simulteniasly and a bible (god knows I need it).
  One terminal is the server(BeagleBone Grean/Black) and three clients (with less there might be errors, alltough can be changed in the code).
* Second: When you want to exit the chatroom, as a client press 'q + Enter'.
  As the server you can not exit by your self,you need ALL THE CLIENTS to exit for the server to exit. (Or just 'Ctrl + C', you do you...).
* Theard: Please dont just press 'Enter' without a text multiple times. Its annoying. It took me 2 hours to try and fix the sonbitch.
* Fourth: And now on a more positive note I had alot of fun making it and I learnd a lot hope you enjoy it as I did.
